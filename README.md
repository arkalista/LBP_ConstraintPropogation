Data augmentation techniques have been employed to overcome the problem of model over-fitting in deep convolutional neural networks and have consistently shown improvement in classification. Most data augmentation techniques perform affine transformations on the image domain. However these techniques cannot be used when object position is significant in the image. In this work we propose a data augmentation technique based on sampling a representation built by inequality constraints propagated from local binary patterns.
